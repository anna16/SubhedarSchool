                            <p>General Education Institute, Dadar is one of the well-known education institutes, which deserves a long history. Education is very important integral portion of human civilization, Educational history; it possesses different cultural edge, which not only owns the importance with respect to specific institution. And therefore it will not be wrong statement If, I say that GEI’s glorious history of 125 years throws light on existence of Maharashtra.</p>
                            <p>In very adverse condition, Late. G.N. Akshikar, in the year 1892 with patriotic spiritual intention in mind and with the help of our friend has started small school in village like Dadar. The same GEI has grown into today’s empire of 45 Schools and is growing day by day with 18000+ numbers of students on muster roll. Initially the Institution was running Marathi medium schools only, which gradually spread wings with incorporation of English medium school, CBSE & International School, along with Junior college & Girls College with the help of SNDT University. While doing this GEI successfully kept aside all the ideas, thoughts & practices of bureaucratic culture & of commercial nature, which itself is one of the strength of our Institution and second significant strength is participation of teaching and nonteaching staff in the management of the Institution. Because of which it shows the democratic style of working is in tune with the functioning of the institution.</p>

                    <div className="row">
                            <p>Not relying upon historical back ground of the Institution, from time to time, Institution has suggested suitable concepts which were expected by the present and future; to tune up with the upcoming age, the Institution has made progress, from the ancient style of teaching upto the latest collaborative learning & e-learning, with the support of modernization of school campus, buildings, computerization and constructive regulation. To stand on the edge of this competitive world, Institution has also incorporated the essential new courses for the students and training programs for teaching staff which are useful in personality development.</p>
                            <p>We have started sports academy, like that various concepts are on the stage of practical execution and I must underline that just like bright history of last 125 years the upcoming future of further 125 years of the institution will also be very successful.</p>
                            <p>When you consider that the Educational Institutions are indicators of the society and culture, then keep it in mind and it is certain, that GEI is carrying great responsibility.
